# Versus-Fighter-0
 Unity game build ;-;

I don't need to explain, do I? You just need to download the whole repo and then run 'VersusFighter.exe'

PS: If you want to see what the OG game is, copy [this code](https://pastebin.com/E6nquEuJ), install pygame (`pip install pygame`, nothing more) and then play the game. You'd definitely say that this is better than the repo game
